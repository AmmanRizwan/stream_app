# IAStream
**IAStrem** is a free, web-based streaming platform that offers a Netflix-like experience, but with a key difference: it allows you to access a wide range of movies, TV shows, and videos for free. Just like Netflix, you can browse content by genre, popularity, or search for specific titles.

The platform aggregates content from multiple sources, allowing you to watch movies and shows without needing multiple subscriptions. While it’s built on the popular **Stremio** platform, **IAStrem** leverages free and sometimes community-driven add-ons that pull in content from official streaming services, user-generated libraries, and even torrent-based sources.

With a simple, intuitive interface, **IAStrem** is designed to help you discover and enjoy media content in one place. Whether you’re into the latest blockbusters, classic films, or binge-worthy series, you can find it all for free.

**Note:** While the app is free to use, some add-ons may access content that is not officially licensed, so it’s important to be aware of potential legal implications when using third-party sources.
